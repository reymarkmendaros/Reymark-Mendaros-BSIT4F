# Virtual Machines vs. Containers Comparison Report

| Category | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers (e.g., Docker) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Guest OS running on top of a Hypervisor | Shared Host OS kernel managed by Container Engine |
| **Boot Time** | Minutes (requires full OS startup) | Seconds (isolated process startup) |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Heavy (requires GBs of RAM and dedicated disk space per VM) | Lightweight (MBs of RAM, shares host kernel resources) |
| **Isolation Level** | Hardware-level isolation via Hypervisor | Process-level isolation via Linux namespaces & cgroups |

## Client Summary Recommendation

Transitioning your web applications to containerization directly addresses your current performance bottlenecks. Because containers share the underlying host operating system kernel instead of running separate Guest OS instances, they eliminate hypervisor overhead and drastically lower RAM usage. Furthermore, containers start up in seconds rather than minutes, allowing rapid horizontal scaling during traffic spikes. Adopting Docker ensures your applications run consistently across development, staging, and production environments while significantly lowering infrastructure compute costs.
